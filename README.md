Dockerfile: Createq a Dockerfile as I provided to package Node.js application into a Docker image.

Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline: I have set up a Jenkins pipeline that pulls then source code, builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile, and then pushes the Docker image to a container registry such as Docker Hub.

Kubernetes Deployment: Created Kubernetes deployment configurations (deployment.yml) to deploy  Docker image as pods in your Kubernetes cluster. I also created a service (service.yml) to expose your backend services within the cluster.

Kubernetes Secrets: If the application requires any sensitive information (like AWS credentials), store them securely in Kubernetes secrets and mount them into your application pods as environment variables.

Integration with AWS Resources: Updated the application code or Kubernetes configuration to interact with AWS resources like DynamoDB. Make sure Docker image has the necessary permissions to access these resources.

Continuous Deployment: Configure Jenkins pipeline to trigger Kubernetes deployments whenever there are changes to your Docker image or Kubernetes configuration files.

Testing and Monitoring: Implement testing and monitoring solutions to ensure the reliability and performance the application running in Kubernetes.
