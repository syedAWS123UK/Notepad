Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile as I provided earlier to package your Node.js application into a Docker image.

Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a Jenkins pipeline that pulls your source code, builds your Docker image using the Dockerfile, and then pushes the Docker image to a container registry such as Docker Hub.

Kubernetes Deployment: Create Kubernetes deployment configurations (deployment.yml) to deploy your Docker image as pods in your Kubernetes cluster. You'll also need to create a service (service.yml) to expose your backend services within the cluster.

Kubernetes Secrets: If your application requires any sensitive information (like AWS credentials), store them securely in Kubernetes secrets and mount them into your application pods as environment variables.

Integration with AWS Resources: Update your application code or Kubernetes configuration to interact with AWS resources like DynamoDB. Make sure your Docker image has the necessary permissions to access these resources.

Continuous Deployment: Configure your Jenkins pipeline to trigger Kubernetes deployments whenever there are changes to your Docker image or Kubernetes configuration files.

Testing and Monitoring: Implement testing and monitoring solutions to ensure the reliability and performance of your application running in Kubernetes.
